## Getting Help ##

If you have a question about nuxx or have encountered problems using it,
start by asking a question on [slack][slack]

## Submitting a Pull Request ##

Do you have an improvement?

1. Submit an [issue][issue] describing your proposed change.
2. I will try to respond to your issue promptly.
3. Fork this repo, develop and test your code changes.
4. Submit a pull request against this repo's `master` branch.
    - Include instructions on how to test your changes.
5. Your branch may be merged once all configured checks pass.

## Committing ##

Squash or rebase commits so that all changes from a branch are
committed to master as a single commit. All pull requests are squashed when
merged, but rebasing prior to merge gives you better control over the commit
message.
